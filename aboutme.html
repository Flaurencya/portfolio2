<h2> Intro to Flaur </h2>
<p>  Hi, I’m Flaurencya. I’m currently a senior at the Bronx High School of Science where I’m a traveler of history and physics enthusiast who also serves as the Engineering and Design head on the Fe Maidens, that’s “Iron Maidens,”  all-girls robotics team. I’m passionate in doing research and design for robots, business models, architecture, and programming. I also do student research at a bioengineering systems lab at Mt. Sinai. <p>

<h2> My Projects </h2>
<div> I am currently working on a platform where people across the U.S. can share their inspiring stories of immigration and surviving in the Conncrete Jungle as well as a small business that sells traditional Indonesian batik wares where some of the proceeds go to the Love of Emmanuel for Indonesian orphanges. </div>
<h2> My Passions </h2>
<h3> The Fe Maidens: An all-girls robotics team based in Bronx Science </h3>
  Last spring, a sisterhood of forty-eight green-and-purple-clad valkyries, flanked by a cyclop-eyed robot, joined in the international foray of female trailblazers. Their “battle”? Breaking the polycarbonate ceiling of gender inequality. Their "battleground"? An NYC FIRST Robotics regional competition on the northern flange of Manhattan. Their Valhalla? An unassuming basement at Bronx Science. For two years, I've served as Design Captain of the FeMaidens- "Iron Maidens"- one of the nation’s few all-girls robotics teams.
<p> Throughout the school year, I dedicate twenty-five hours a week to lead and teach a department of eight valkyries how to use Fusion 360, CNC, laser and 3D printing, and collaborate on a FeMaiden leadership board of distinguished girls who I -personally- consider goddesses. Over the summer and school breaks, I volunteer at fairs (i.e. Bronx Parade, Maker-Faire, etc.) and teach design/construction to inexperienced robotics students (i.e MHSHS FTC, Brazil’s 5800 FRC, and All-Girls Chapin FLL). Few words can describe how spending hours on end with fellow valkyries, entrusting each other to design, build, wire, and code our robot has instilled an overwhelming sense of passion, connection, and devotion to, foremostly, empowering females and conjunctively tearing down gender-oriented disparities in engineering. <p>
<p> I’ve accrued an indispensable amount of engineering and leadership skills to weave change into an empirically male-dominated industry, but my ambrosia is an <em> insatiable </em> desire to collaborate with women and break stereotypes in my future endeavors. If designing two robots can help a generation of girls to pursue anything they want “like a girl”, giving new meaning to “they’re pretty good-for girls”, then just imagine how learning code can help me achieve my dreams of entrepreneurship, development platforms to help shatter the glass ceiling. <p>
